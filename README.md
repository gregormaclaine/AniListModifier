# Anilist Modifier

This is a chrome extension that loads when going to the [Anilist Homepage](https://anilist.co/home). I had an issue where I didn't like that when I saw a friend complete a show on my feed, I couldn't tell what they rated it without clicking through onto their list and finding the entry. Therefore here's an extension that injects a script which calls the Anilist API and modifies the activity feed so that it now includes the rating.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Without Extension</th>
        <th>With Extension</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="docs/unmodified.png" alt="Feed without the extension">
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="docs/modified.png" alt="Feed with the extension active">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
