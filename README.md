## Download

The tool is currently available in the chrome extension store and you can install it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anilist-modifier/knclmpfhlbdlndgplhbnpajhpjmklfpi).

You may also compile the most recent version yourself if you prefer. To do this you will need to download or clone this repository, and then run:

- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm build` or `yarn build`

This will compile the typescript and move all necessary files to the `build/` folder. This folder can then be installed as an extension by enabling developer mode on the extensions tab.
