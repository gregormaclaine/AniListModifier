# Anilist Modifier

This is a chrome extension that loads when going to the [Anilist Homepage](https://anilist.co/home). I had an issue where I didn't like that when I saw a friend complete a show on my feed, I couldn't tell what they rated it without clicking through onto their list and finding the entry. Therefore here's an extension that injects a script which calls the Anilist API and modifies the activity feed so that it now includes the rating.
