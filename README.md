# AniList Modifier

This is a chrome extension that loads when going to the [AniList Homepage](https://anilist.co/home). I had an issue where I didn't like that when I saw a friend complete a show on my feed, I couldn't tell what they rated it without clicking through onto their list and finding the entry. Therefore here's an extension that injects a script which calls the AniList API and modifies the activity feed so that it now includes the rating.

## Download

The tool is currently pending in the chrome extension store, however if you would not like to wait you can download the extension directly here. Note you will only need the files `injection.js`, `background.js`, `manifest.json`, and the `icons/` folder. These can then be installed by enabling developer mode on the extensions tab.
